Dice auto apply is a project I started when I was looking for new full time positions.

There is a feature in Dice called `easy apply` where you just click adn boom, your resume sent to the job poster.

# How to use:
1 - Install all the requirements with 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2 - Create a file with name `.env` on yor project folder then place your dice username and password
```python
EMAIL=your_username
PASSWORD=your_password
```

3 - Run main.py
```bash
python main.py
```

a - I might be adding more features to control the search parameters.

b - Generate Resume with Skill Sets required for each job and update resume on Dice.
