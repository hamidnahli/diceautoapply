Dice auto apply is a project I started when I started looking for new full time positions.

There is a feature in Dice called `easy apply` where you just click adn boom, your resume sent to the job poster.

# How to use:
1 - Install all the requirements with 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2 - Run main.py
```bash
python main.py
```

Do you want to learn more about the process of building this, I wrote an article on @medium about it

3 - Future updates:

a - I might be adding more features to control the search parameters.

b - Generate Resume with Skill Sets required for each job and update resume on Dice.
